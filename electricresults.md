# Results
Write the results of your experiments below when modifying the 4 inputs to see the result of the 5 outputs.

## All true
What happended when all of your values started as true?
        The output of ready = true,
        The output of unPaid = false,
        The output of oldPeople = false,
        The output of unsure = false,
        The output of broken = true,

## All false
What happended when all of your values started as false?
        The output of ready = false,
        The output of unPaid = false,
        The output of oldPeople = false,
        The output of unsure = true,
        The output of broken = false,

## First two true, last two false
